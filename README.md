The Amazon Scraper is a Python-based project designed to extract product details such as name, price, rating, reviews, availability, and image URLs from Amazon search results. 
Using Selenium for browser automation and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, the scraper navigates through multiple search result pages, collects the product data, and saves it into a CSV file. 
The project supports customization of search queries and the number of pages to scrape, making it ideal for market research, price tracking, and competitor analysis.
It's simple to set up and can be easily extended for more complex scraping tasks.
